Our [Run Models CoLab](input/industries) provides Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), MLP, RandomForest, XGBoost 

Our main input is currently industry features by county for exploring environmental impact targets.  
We are also creating [CoLabs for Exiobase International Trade Flow](/profile/trade).
